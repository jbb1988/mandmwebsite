# Internal Linking Strategy for Mind & Muscle

Internal links help Google understand your site structure, distribute page authority, and improve user navigation. This document outlines strategic internal links to implement across your website.

## 🎯 Linking Principles

1. **Use descriptive anchor text** - Not "click here" but "baseball training app"
2. **Link to relevant pages** - Only link when contextually appropriate
3. **Don't overdo it** - 2-5 strategic internal links per page is ideal
4. **Link deeper** - Not just to homepage, but to specific feature/service pages

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **❌ Don't use generic anchor text**
   - Bad: "click here", "learn more", "read more"
   - Good: "baseball training app", "team licensing options", "partner program"

2. **❌ Don't link to the same page you're on**
   - Never link to the current page (it confuses users and wastes link equity)

3. **❌ Don't over-optimize**
   - Use varied anchor text (not always exact-match keywords)
   - Don't force links where they don't make sense

4. **❌ Don't link too much**
   - Quality > quantity (5 strategic links > 20 random links)

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Links

After implementation, verify:

1. **All links work** (no 404s)
2. **Links open in same tab** (internal links should NOT open new tab)
3. **Mobile-friendly** (links are easy to tap on mobile)
4. **Visual feedback** (hover states, underlines, color changes)

Use Google Search Console → **Links report** to see internal linking structure.
