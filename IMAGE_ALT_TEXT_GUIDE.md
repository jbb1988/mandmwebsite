# Image Alt Text Optimization Guide

This guide provides best practices for image alt text on the Mind & Muscle website for both SEO and accessibility.

## üéØ Alt Text Principles

1. **Descriptive but concise** - Describe what's in the image in 5-15 words
2. **Contextual** - Consider how the image relates to surrounding content
3. **Keyword-aware** - Include relevant keywords naturally (don't stuff)
4. **Decorative images** - Use `alt=""` for purely decorative images
5. **No "image of"** - Screen readers announce it's an image automatically

---

## ‚úÖ Current Status

**Images with empty alt text**: 5 (found via audit)

These are located in:
- /src/app/page.tsx (homepage)
- /src/app/partner-program/page.tsx
- /src/app/faq/page.tsx
- /src/app/team-licensing/page.tsx
- /src/app/support/page.tsx

**Most of these are decorative background/watermark images** and correctly have empty alt text.

---

## üîç Image Audit Results

### Decorative Images (Correct: alt="")

These images are purely visual and should keep `alt=""`:

1. **Logo watermarks** - Background decorative logos
2. **Gradient overlays** - CSS-like visual effects
3. **Decorative icons** - When text already describes the content

**Example** (correct usage):
```tsx
<Image
  src="/assets/images/logo.png"
  alt="" // Correct - decorative watermark
  width={1200}
  height={1200}
  className="opacity-[0.04]"
/>
```

### Functional Images (Need descriptive alt text)

Images that convey information or function should have descriptive alt text:

1. **Product screenshots** - Describe what feature is shown
2. **Feature icons** - Describe the feature
3. **Team photos** - Describe who/what is shown
4. **Infographics** - Summarize key information

---

## üìã Recommended Alt Text by Image Type

### 1. App Screenshots

**Location**: `/public/assets/screenshots/`

**Format**: "Mind & Muscle [feature name] showing [key elements]"

**Examples**:
```tsx
// Bad
<Image src="/screenshot-1.png" alt="Screenshot" />

// Good
<Image src="/screenshot-1.png" alt="Mind & Muscle mental training dashboard showing session progress and streak tracker" />

// Better (with keywords)
<Image src="/screenshot-1.png" alt="Baseball mental skills training app dashboard with AI coach recommendations" />
```

### 2. Feature Icons

**Location**: Throughout pages (Mind Coach, Muscle Coach, etc.)

**Format**: "[Feature name] - [brief description]"

**Examples**:
```tsx
// Bad
<Image src="/mind-coach-icon.png" alt="Icon" />

// Good
<Image src="/mind-coach-icon.png" alt="Mind Coach AI - mental training and focus development" />

// Also acceptable
<Image src="/mind-coach-icon.png" alt="Brain icon representing mental training features" />
```

### 3. Logo (Non-decorative)

**Location**: Navigation, Footer

**Format**: "Mind & Muscle logo" or "Mind & Muscle - Baseball Training App"

**Example**:
```tsx
// In navigation
<Image src="/logo.png" alt="Mind & Muscle" width={150} height={50} />

// As link to homepage
<Link href="/">
  <Image src="/logo.png" alt="Mind & Muscle baseball training app home" />
</Link>
```

### 4. Team/Person Photos

**Format**: "[Person name/role] - [context]"

**Examples**:
```tsx
<Image src="/coach-john.jpg" alt="Coach John demonstrating proper batting stance" />
<Image src="/athlete-sarah.jpg" alt="Youth baseball player Sarah completing mental training session" />
```

### 5. Charts/Graphs/Infographics

**Format**: Brief summary of data/key takeaway

**Examples**:
```tsx
// Bad
<Image src="/chart.png" alt="Chart" />

// Good
<Image src="/chart.png" alt="Graph showing 40% improvement in batting average after 8 weeks of mental training" />
```

## ‚úèÔ∏è Writing Alt Text Guidelines

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Be specific and descriptive
- ‚úÖ Include context when relevant
- ‚úÖ Use keywords naturally
- ‚úÖ Keep it under 125 characters
- ‚úÖ Describe important text in images

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Start with "Image of" or "Picture of"
- ‚ùå Be overly verbose (novel-length descriptions)
- ‚ùå Keyword stuff
- ‚ùå Describe decorative images (use alt="")
- ‚ùå Say "link to" (screen readers announce links)

### Examples:

**‚ùå Bad Alt Text:**
```tsx
<Image alt="Image of a baseball player" />
<Image alt="Picture showing the Mind & Muscle app interface with various features including mental training and strength training and game IQ" />
<Image alt="Baseball baseball training baseball app" /> // keyword stuffing
```

**‚úÖ Good Alt Text:**
```tsx
<Image alt="Baseball player completing mental training session on Mind & Muscle app" />
<Image alt="Mind & Muscle dashboard showing training progress and AI recommendations" />
<Image alt="Youth baseball team using team licensing features for coordinated training" />
```

## üìä SEO Impact

**Why alt text matters for SEO:**

1. **Image search** - Images appear in Google Image Search
2. **Context signals** - Helps Google understand page content
3. **Accessibility** - Improves site usability score
4. **Link context** - When images are links, alt text is anchor text

**Target keywords to include (naturally):**
- "baseball training app"
- "mental skills training"
- "AI coaching"
- "team licensing"
- "youth baseball"
- "strength training"
