## Program Settings

### 1. Commission Structure

- This applies to both initial purchase AND annual renewals

**Commission Type**: `Revenue Share (Recurring)`

**Example Calculation**:
```
Team license: $107/seat √ó 12 seats = $1,284/year
Partner commission: $1,284 √ó 10% = $128.40

Year 1: $128.40
Year 2: $128.40 (renewal)
Year 3: $128.40 (renewal)
Total over 3 years: $385.20

## Integrations

Navigate to **Integrations** ‚Üí **Stripe**

**Purpose**: Automatically sync Stripe subscriptions with Tolt

2. Authorize Tolt to access Stripe data
3. Map Stripe products to Tolt programs:

**Our Approach**:
```typescript
// We manually notify Tolt via API
POST https://api.tolt.io/v1/conversions
{
  "referral_code": "PARTNER_CODE",
  "amount": 1284.00,
  "customer_email": "customer@example.com",
  "external_id": "sub_xxx",
  "metadata": {
    "subscription_id": "sub_xxx",
    "is_renewal": false
  }
}
```

### 2. Email Integration (Optional)

Navigate to **Integrations** ‚Üí **Email**

Connect your email service (e.g., SendGrid, Mailchimp) to:
- Send partner welcome emails
- Notify partners of new conversions
- Send monthly earnings reports

### 3. Zapier Integration (Optional)

Use Zapier to:
- Post to Slack when new partner signs up

## Advanced Configuration

- `refund.created`

### 2. Custom Partner Portal (Future)

If you outgrow Tolt's partner dashboard, you can build your own:

```typescript
// Fetch partner data via Tolt API
const response = await fetch('https://api.tolt.io/v1/partners/me', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${partnerToken}`,
  },
});

const data = await response.json();
// Display in your custom dashboard
```

**When to consider custom portal**:
- 100+ active partners
- Need custom branding
- Want to integrate with your own analytics
- Need advanced features (tiered commissions, bonuses, contests)

### 3. Fraud Detection

Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Fraud Detection**

Enable:

- ‚úÖ Suspicious referral pattern detection
- ‚úÖ Cookie stuffing detection
- ‚úÖ Self-referral detection

**Actions**:
- Flag suspicious conversions for manual review
- Auto-reject obvious fraud attempts
- Notify partner of flagged activity

---

## Mobile App Affiliate Tracking

Since our mobile app doesn't use Tolt's JavaScript tracking, we handle it manually:

### How It Works

1. **User enters affiliate code in app**
   - Code stored in user's profile: `profiles.affiliate_code`
   - Timestamp recorded: `profiles.referred_at`

2. **User redeems team code**
   - App checks if user has `affiliate_code`
   - If yes, tracks that they're part of an affiliate-referred team

3. **Future purchase tracking** (To Implement)
   - When mobile user upgrades to premium or buys individual subscription
   - Backend sends conversion to Tolt:
   ```typescript
   POST https://api.tolt.io/v1/conversions
   {
     "referral_code": user.affiliate_code,
     "amount": purchase_amount,
     "customer_email": user.email,
     "external_id": subscription_id,
     "metadata": {
       "source": "mobile_app",
       "platform": "ios" // or "android"
     }
   }
   ```

---

2. Name: "Test Coach"
