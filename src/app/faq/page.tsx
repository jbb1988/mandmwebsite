          question: 'What are binaural beats?',
          answer: 'Binaural beats are audio frequencies that sync your brainwaves to specific mental states.

Feel your brain lock in.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How long should I listen?',
          answer: 'For best results, listen for at least 10 minutes to allow your brainwaves to sync to the frequency. Pre-game sessions are typically 10-15 minutes. Longer sessions (20-30 minutes) are great for deep focus work or pre-sleep recovery.'

        {
          question: 'Can I use Sound Lab while training?',
