Hi Cory,

I'm reaching out because I believe D-BAT is perfectly positioned to offer something no other training facility franchise has: **complete player development that includes AI-powered mental training**.

**Quick intro:** I'm Jeff, founder of Mind & Muscle - an AI platform that combines mental training, swing analysis, strength programming, and baseball IQ development into one app. We're already working with travel organizations, training facilities, and private coaches nationwide.

**Why D-BAT specifically:**

D-BAT's mission is "complete player development" - but right now that means physical skills only. What happens when your athletes leave the cage? Most go home and... nothing. The mental side of the game - focus, confidence, pressure handling, baseball IQ - gets ignored until game time.

Mind & Muscle fills that gap with:
- **5-minute pre-lesson mental focus routines** (via QR codes in your facility)
- **AI swing analysis** (athletes upload cage videos for instant feedback)
- **186 real game scenarios** for baseball IQ development
- **Position-specific strength training** designed for rotational power
- **Goal tracking and mental coaching** between lessons

**The partnership model:**

We're proposing an affiliate partnership where D-BAT locations earn **10-15% commission** on every athlete subscription (10% base, 15% at 101+ users). For context:
- A location with 200 active athletes could generate **$3,000+/year** in passive revenue
- With 300+ athletes: **$5,000+/year**
- Zero cost, zero staff, zero inventory

We provide everything: QR code posters for your facility, email templates, social graphics, and tracking dashboards.

**I built a custom page for D-BAT:** https://mindandmuscle.ai/dbat

This shows the value prop, earnings calculator, and partnership details specifically for D-BAT franchise owners.

**My ask:**

I'd love 15 minutes to discuss whether a franchise-wide partnership makes sense. We could either:
1. Roll this out across all 180+ locations as an official D-BAT partner
2. Start with a pilot group of interested franchisees

Either way, early-adopter locations could start earning immediately.

Are you open to a quick call next week?

Best,
**Jeff Butt**

P.S. - I've already compiled contact info for 140+ D-BAT locations. Happy to share that list or coordinate outreach however works best for the franchise.
